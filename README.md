# object-detection
Detect rectangle, square, round, triangle and diamond shape objects

1. Edge detection: Canny algorithm
2. Hough transform
    - Purpose: Either edge detector or image can be imperfect. Therefore, there may be missing points on the missing edges. For this reason, Hough transform addresses this problem by performing voting procedure which connects the missing edges.
